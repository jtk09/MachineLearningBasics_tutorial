# MachineLearningBasics_tutorial

This repo contains a jupyter notebook which provides for interactive use of some of the most commonly used routines in Python's scikit-learn machine learning package. This notebook was used written for demonstration purposes in Florida State University's inaugural Data Science and Machine Learning seminar Fall 2019.

Specifically, the notebook demonstrates:
1) how to load the Boston housing dataset from sci-kit learn.
2) how to split the data into training and test sets
3) how to fit the training data to linear regression models using linear and polynomial features (polynomial order is a hyperparameter)
4) how to estimate generalization error for each model
5) how to implement ridge regression regularization and K-fold cross validation
